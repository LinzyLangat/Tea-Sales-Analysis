# Tea Sales Analysis – Power BI Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes tea production and employee performance for September 2025. The dataset was manually recorded in Excel and contains daily entries for each employee, including:

- Employee number and name
- Date and week
- Day of the week
- Weight of tea collected (Kgs)
- Amount paid (Ksh)
- Attendance records

The analysis focuses on tracking cumulative production, weekly performance, and total payments using Power BI. Interactive dashboards provide insights into overall productivity and individual contributions throughout the month.

## Data Collection and Preparation
The dataset was manually compiled and entered into Excel to ensure accuracy and a structure suitable for analysis in Power BI. The data represents tea production records for September, including key details such as employee information, cumulative tea weight (kgs), and weekly payments.

**Steps followed:**

1. Performed manual data entry and cleaning to remove inconsistencies.
2. Verified and included important details such as employee names, weekly totals, and payment rates.
3. Calculated the total amount paid (Ksh) from Week 1 through Week 4 for each employee.
4. Reformatted the dataset into a tabular structure ready for import into Power BI.

## Data Analysis and Visualization
The analysis was carried out in Power BI Desktop. Key measures and visuals were created to highlight production and performance trends.
